        <p>Whoever has been playing games for more than 10 years now has experienced a gradual decline in the quality of games. In a time, where every industry is evolving for the better, it seems the inherent product that drives video game industry is gradually worsening. There are repeated examples of fiasco in the mainstream gaming culture which is destroying the overall climate of this sub-culture. </p>
        
        <p>Game-developers have been indifferent to such marked deficiencies in their product; it is shown by the repeated bugs and arbitrary practice of micro-transaction that they have involved in virtually every AAA release. When a person buys a product, least he can hope is ownership, even if the product outright sloppy and bad. Software and digital product has helped the industry move forward however, but the progress is inversely proportionate to decline in quality with massive imbalance.
