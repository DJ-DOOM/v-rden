        <p>In some games where there are leaderboards and the goal is to reach the top, you can easily pay your way into reaching top. I am literally done with playing most games whether it'd be mobile or online games. Theres really no point of playing to reach the top of leaderboards when a rich kid can just spew money into the game without even trying. What people who pay alot for games dont realize is that "the fun" players like me have is through hard work and dedication to a game. Its not about being poor and not affording 5 dollars to pay for something in game. Its just boring to pay for something without work and not dedicating your time into it. Its simply paying without even trying to play a game which makes no sense. Back then traditional games werent like that. You just pay once and you can enjoy the game. Now the concept of making games to earn money is getting counter-intuitive. Some Game devs especially mobile games thought that if they gave OP features from players paying extra, then theyll expect players to consistently pay more. However, it gets to a point where everyone who only pays will win and people who try working hard without going the lazy route never reach the top. The game itself becomes pointless because it is taken over by rich players and then the competition itself to reach top has no meaning at all. </p>
        
        <p>I can agree that some in game add-ons from paying dont have the pay-to-win concept. Maybe they may just be cosmetics or small boosts for a player which is fine because it doesnt really affect gameplay a lot but some add-ons are beyond overpowered and give players completely unfair advantages. The original intention of games was simply for fun. Now in the 21st century games are just becoming industries for making alot of money. Game developers follow a tactic of luring kids or players to spend money into it. Many players will become bankrupt in the future if the pay-to-win concept continues and gets worse. The idea of electronic games will then transition into gambling. </p>
