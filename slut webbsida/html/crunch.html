        <p>Phrases that get thrown around a lot in discussions about the video games industry are “crunch culture”, “crunch time”, and “crunch crisis”. </p>
        
        <p>But what is crunch in video games? In this brief blog post we’re going to gather up a lot of the thinking about it, and give our perspective. </p>

        <p>As a word of caution, as with any piece that features opinion, this is going to be heavily biased by our experience, our thoughts as a group of people, the past successes and failures of the studio, the way certain laws work in our country, and so on. For example, we’re based in the UK, so we don’t rely on employment in order to continue receiving health insurance to cover private medical bills, a factor that might heavily influence a person’s motivations for accepting crunch in, say, the United States. Ultimately crunch is a thing that affects human beings, so by its nature much of what will be discussed is subjective and we’re not here to judge people for their feelings toward the topic - we’re just presenting some of the threads of thought on the matter and then stating our opinion. </p>
