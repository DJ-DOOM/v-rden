        <p>The Quality of Life (QoL) issue for game developers has improved quite a lot since a decade ago. The pre-2004 work environment was a bit worse for everybody, and more similar to some other industries. Today it is only a problem in some studios, and usually only for programmers. </p>
        
        <p>Bad QoL at a studio happens mostly because of bad management and because the law allows it. Bad management because they don't properly manage project scope. Studios where crunch is a problem tend to have it on every project. Bring in a good manager who can scope correctly, his teams will not crunch on any project. I have seen studios with both good and bad managers, one manager's team always had a bad crunch, the other never had crunch, for the entire five years I watched them. On one project they ended up swapping projects mid-way through, the no-overtime manager immediately started slashing features. Workers are also partly responsible, dev teams that spend their day surfing the web and watching videos all day are going to crunch because the work is still there, waiting for them. If the workers put in 8 great hours, and the management is doing their job, crunch does not happen. I have had two awesome managers who gave six consecutive projects with zero crunch (one of them mentioned above). I had another manager who gave two years of rapid releases with only one bad crunch out of nearly 50 quick releases -- the only crunch was caused by a programmer getting hospitalized for several weeks in a car accident. We could have cancelled that release, but after talking it over with everyone the crunch was voluntary, people were brought in from other teams to help the larger team succeed, and the studio decided to compensate those who worked the extra hours even though legally it was not mandatory. The studio talked about QoL issues, which contributed to people wanting to help out. If the studio had been bad about QoL before people probably would not have helped out, letting that release fail. </p>
